<ul>
  
<li>An inability to think about anything else</li>

 <li>Feeling mentally exhausted</li>
 <li>Having a lot of negative thoughts</li>
 <li>Replaying a situation or experience in your mind</li>
 <li>Second-guessing your decisions</li>
 <li>Thinking of all the worst-case scenarios</li>
 <li>Causes of Overthinking</li>
<li>Overthinking can happen for several reasons. Here are a few to consider.</li>
</ul>

Not Being Solution-Focused
Overthinking is different from problem-solving. Overthinking is about dwelling on the problem, while problem-solving involves looking
for a solution.
Imagine a storm is coming. Here’s the difference between overthinking and problem-solving:

Overthinking:
“I wish the storm wouldn’t come. It’s going to be awful. I hope the house doesn’t get damaged.
Why do these things always have to happen to me? I can’t handle this.”
Problem-solving:
“I will go outside and pick up everything that might blow away. I’ll put sandbags against the garage door to prevent flooding.
If we get a lot of rain I’ll go to the store to buy plywood so I can board up the windows.”
Problem-solving can lead to productive action. Overthinking, on the other hand, fuels uncomfortable emotions and doesn’t look for solutions.
Experiencing Repetitive Thoughts Ruminating—or rehashing the same things over and over again—isn’t helpful. But, when you’re overthinking, you might find yourself replaying a conversation in your head repeatedly or imagining something bad happening many times. Dwelling on your problems, mistakes, and shortcomings, increases your risk of mental health problems, according to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology.3﻿﻿ As your mental health declines, you are more likely you are to ruminate on your thoughts. It’s a repetitive cycle that can be tough to break. Your Brain Won’t Shut Off When you’re overthinking you might feel like your brain won’t shut off. When you try to sleep, you might even feel as though your brain is on overdrive as it replays scenarios in your head and causes you to imagine bad things happening. Research confirms what you likely already know—rumination interferes with sleep. Overthinking makes it harder to fall asleep. Overthinking impairs the quality of your sleep too. So it’s harder to fall into a deep slumber when your brain is busy overthinking everything.4﻿ Difficulty falling asleep may contribute to more worrisome thoughts. For example, when you don’t fall asleep right away, you might imagine that you’ll be overtired the following day. That may cause you to feel anxious—which may make it even harder to fall asleep. Making Decisions Is a Struggle You might try to convince yourself that thinking longer and harder helps you. After all, you’re looking at a problem from every possible angle. But, overanalyzing and obsessing actually becomes a barrier. Research shows thinking too much makes it tough to make decisions.5 If you’re indecisive about everything from what to eat for dinner to which hotel you should book, you might be overthinking things. It’s very likely that you are wasting a lot of time looking for second opinions and researching your options, when ultimately, those little choices might not matter so much. Rumination: Why Do People Obsess Over Things? Decisions are Second-Guessed Overthinking sometimes involves beating yourself up for the decisions you already made. You could waste a lot of time thinking your life would be better if you’d only taken that other job or not started a business. Or maybe you get upset with yourself for not seeing red flags sooner—because you believe they should have been obvious! And while a little healthy self-reflection can help you learn from your mistakes, rehashing and second-guessing is a form of mental torture. Overthinking can take a toll on your mood and may make it even more difficult to make decisions in the future. Types of Overthinking There are also different types of overthinking that a person might engage in. Many of these are caused by cognitive distortions, which are negative or distorted ways of thinking. All-or-Nothing Thinking This type of overthinking involves only seeing situations in black or white. Instead of looking at both the good and the bad, you might analyze an event only in terms of it being a total success or a total failure. Catastrophizing This type of overthinking involves thinking things are worse than they are. For example, you might fear that you will fail an exam. This then leads to worry that you will fail the class, which will then lead to failing school, not getting a degree, and not being able to find a job. This type of overthinking sets you up to worry about unrealistic worst-case scenarios. Overgeneralizing This form of overthinking happens when you base a rule or expectation for the future on a single or random event from the past.6 Instead of accepting that different outcomes are possible, you might assume that certain things will “always” or “never” happen. In this case, overgeneralizing one event from the past to every event in the future often leads to overthinking and worrying about things that might never occur. Effects of Overthinking Overthinking is not a mental illness, and while overthinking can make you anxious, it is not necessarily the same thing as anxiety. However, it can often play a role in the development and maintenance of several mental health conditions. Some disorders that are associated with overthinking include: Depression Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Panic disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Social anxiety disorder (SAD) Overthinking can have a bidirectional relationship with mental health issues.
